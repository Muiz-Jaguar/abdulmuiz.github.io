    <h1>Friends:</h1>
    <p>
      I have many friends. But the ones I am listing are those who helped me
      make this website and responded when I needed them:

          <a href="Sareb.html">Sareb&nbsp;Janjua</a><br />Sareb is one of my
          newest best friends. We weren't very good friends in school, but we
          became great friends through whatsapp. He is a programmer, and a web
          developer. He always helps me with computer stuff whenever i crash
          something. The best thing about Sareb is that his response time is
          extremely fast. He almost always responds to my messages and i dont
          have to wait for a very long time. An interesting fact is that i
          havent met him in real life ever since we became great friends! ðŸ˜‚<br /><br />

          <a href="BinRashid.html">Abdullah&nbsp; Rashid</a><br />Abdullah
          Rashid is one of my oldest friends when i was in section A. He is
          basically very good at studying. At least he used to be. He left
          Saudia in 2020, hence i can only keep in touch with him through
          whatsapp. I love the way he adds emotion to his text while messaging.
          Whenever someone is messaging in a group, i can easily identify(at
          least i think i can) whether it is Abdullah Rashid or someone else.
          The best thing about Abdullah is....he consolidates others and boosts
          their confidence. Mad respect to Abdullah Bin Rashid.<br /><br />
