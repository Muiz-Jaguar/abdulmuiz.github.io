    <h2>Early life:</h2>
    <p>
      When i was just a child, my father got used to work in PTCL. As soon as he
      got the opportunity in Saudia, he didnt hesitate. I have lived in many
      cities of Saudia since we came here. These cities include Hail, Taif,
      Khobar, Riyadh etc. We settled in Al Khobar, and ever since, we live here.
      I have visited Pakistan quite alot of times. And have always been amazed
      by my home city;Lahore.
